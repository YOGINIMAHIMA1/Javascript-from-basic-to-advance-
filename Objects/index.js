/*Task:
A car rental company has asked you to help them organise 
their fleet of vehicles.

1. Create a new object literal and assign it to the 
   variable 'hireCar'.
   
2. Using the dot notation, assign a 'color' property to 
   the hireCar object. Its value should be a string 
   holding a color of your choice.
   
3. Using the dot notation, assign an 'isConvertible' property 
   to the object and give it a boolean value (true/false) 
   of your choice.
   
4. Use the brackets notation to add a 'number of doors' property.

5. Log out the entire object.
